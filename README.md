# Basic Banking System - Swift Mobile App

This repository contains the source code and project files for a basic banking system mobile app developed in Swift. The app allows users to perform transactions such as transferring money between accounts and view transaction history.

## Features

- Transfer money between user accounts
- View transaction history
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Dummy data for testing purposes

## Technologies Used

- Swift: a programming language developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development

## Requirements

- Xcode: The latest version of Xcode should be installed on your system to run the app and build it for testing or deployment.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SalmanShapana/The-Sparks-Foundation-Basic-Mobile-App.git
2. Open the project in Xcode:

- Navigate to the cloned project directory.
- Locate the .xcodeproj file and open it with Xcode.
3. Build and run the app:

- Select the target device or simulator from the Xcode toolbar.
- Click on the "Run" button or press Cmd + R to build and run the app.
4. Explore the app:

- Use the app to transfer money between user accounts.
